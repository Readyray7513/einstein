# Energy Calculator (E = mc²)
This is a simple Python program that calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einstein's famous equation, E = mc².

How It Works
The program prompts the user to input a mass (in kilograms). It then calculates the energy using the formula:
E = mc²
 
Where:
E is the energy in joules,
m is the mass in kilograms,
c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3 * 10^8   meters per second).

The result is printed to the console.

Requirements
Python 3.x

How to Run
Clone or download the repository.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using Python:

python energy_calculator.py
Enter the mass (in kilograms) when prompted.
The program will output the calculated energy in joules.

Example
Enter mass: 1
90000000000000000
This means that 1 kilogram of mass is equivalent to 
9×10 ^ 16 joules of energy.

Notes
The speed of light (c) is approximated as 3 × 10 ^ 8 meters per second.
The program assumes the input mass is in kilograms.
